This file starts with the code from the lab, and follows jlfwong's

how to render from the fragmentShader itself instead of running it
through a separate script, but I'll figure it out sooner or later.

This is a write-up on fog as a shader. Here, I imagine a process
for creating fog through a particle system, while making optimi-
zations.
